### [The Yellow Sign (POD)](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1011292/best-pod-best-classic-style-scenario-play-it)

* 1A or 1B ok
* All Humanoid
* Doesn't scale well for <4 investigators
* Maybe add an extra tick or two between events.
* Or someone plays multiple investigators.


### The Dunwich Horror (CotW) - Great Tier
* [Flavour enhancement](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/92588/dunwich-horror-story-fix)
* No change to gameplay but adds flavour to match the classic story.


### Blood Ties (Base)

* Avoid Scenario 1B: Keeper can easily force a win. Investigators have no chance.
* Alternatively, 1B: Keep track of which zombies originated in the Crypt; those zombies cannot advance the objective. [BSCG]](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1534021/article/21958537#21958537)
* If Scenario 1A: Clue 1 must be seeded in the crypt.

* 1B summons a Chthonian

### Yellow Matter (FA) - Good Tier


### The Stars Aligned (CotW)


### The Inner Sanctum (Base)

* "If there's a scenario in which telling the investigators the possible objectives in advance might be a good idea, it's this one, since going into this blind runs the risk of creating a disappointing anti-climax. However, once the investigators are familiar with the scenario, it becomes extremely good." [SSB](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/728690/scenario-scenario-breakdown-what-works-and-what-do)
* [Limit Summon Worshippers to once per altar per turn](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1534021/article/21958537#21958537)

* Only play 1B
* Don't go into the freezer on first move. Seriously.
* [BSCG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1534021/article/21958537#21958537)
